<p>Simon Blomberg: </p>

<blockquote>

  'machine learning is statistics minus
  any checking of models and
  assumptions'.
  -- Brian D. Ripley (about the difference between machine learning
  and statistics) useR! 2004, Vienna

<p>Andrew Gelman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In that case, maybe we should get rid

<p>There was also the <a href=""http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726""><strong>""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures""</strong> paper</a> by Leo Breiman in 2001 which argued that statisticians rely too heavily on data modeling, and that machine learning techniques are making progress by instead relying on the <em>predictive accuracy</em> of models.</p>

<p>I have misplaced my phone somewhere in the home. I can use the phone locator on the base of the instrument to locate the phone and when I press the phone locator the phone starts beeping.</p>

<p>Frequentist Reasoning: </p>

<p>I can hear the phone beeping. I also have a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming from. Therefore, upon hearing the beep, I infer the area of my home I must search to locate the phone.</p>

<p>Bayesian Reasoning:</p>

<p>I can hear the phone beeping. Now, apart from a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming from, I also know the locations where I have misplaced the phone in the past. So, I combine my inferences using the beeps and my prior information about the locations I have misplaced the phone in the past to identify an area I must search to locate the phone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In mathematics (especially probability
  theory and statistics), a random
  variable (or stochastic variable) is
  (in general) a measurable function 
  that maps a probability space into a
  measurable space. Random variables
  mapping all possible outcomes of an
  event into the real numbers are
  frequently studied in elementary
  statistics and used in the sciences to
  make predictions based on data
  obtained from scientific experiments.
  In addition to scientific
  applications, random variables were
  developed for the analysis of games of
  chance and stochastic  events. The
  utility of random variables comes from
  their ability to capture only the
  mathematical properties necessary to
  answer probabilistic  questions.</p>

<p>Here are some example sets of data, and their standard deviations:</p>

<pre><code>[1,1,1]     standard deviation = 0   (there's no spread)  
[-1,1,3]    standard deviation = 1.6 (some spread) 
[-99,1,101] standard deviation = 82  (big spead)

<p>Deviation means ""distance from the mean"".</p>

<p>""Standard"" here means ""standardized"", meaning the standard deviation and mean are in the same units, unlike variance. </p>

<p>It is convenient to know that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality"" rel=""nofollow"">at least 75%</a> of the data points <em>always</em> lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean (or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68-95-99.7_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">around 95%</a> if the distribution is Normal).</p>

<p>If the distribution happens to be Normal, then 95% of the values are between 70 and 130. </p>

<p>What are the <a href=""http://www.r-project.org/"">R</a> packages you couldn't imagine your daily work with data?
Please list both general and specific tools.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
As for 24.10.10 <code>ggplot2</code> seems to be the winer with 7 votes.</p>

<p>Other packages mentioned more than one are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>plyr</code> - 4</li>
<li><code>RODBC</code>, <code>RMySQL</code> - 4</li>
<li><code>sqldf</code> - 3</li>

<li><code>Hmisc/rms</code> - 2</li>

<li><p>Sometimes correlation is enough. For example, in car insurance, male drivers are correlated with more accidents, so insurance companies charge them more. There is no way you could actually test this for causation. You cannot change the genders of the drivers experimentally.

<li><p>To find causation, you generally need experimental data, not observational data. Though, in economics, they often use observed ""shocks"" to the system to test for causation, like if a CEO dies suddenly and the stock price goes up, you can assume causation. </p></li>

80;2;0;"2010-07-19 19:56:43";8;0;"<p>The basic idea behind this is that football clubs have an age cut-off when determining teams.  In the league my children participate in the age restrictions states that children born after July 31st are placed on the younger team.  This means that two children that are effectively the same age can be playing with two different age groups.  The child born July 31st will be playing on the older team and theoretically be the youngest and smallest on the team and in the league.  The child born on August 1st will be the oldest and largest child in the league and will be able to benefit from that.</p>

<p>The survivorship bias comes because competitive leagues will select the best players for their teams.  The best players in childhood are often the older players since they have additional time for their bodies to mature.  This means that otherwise acceptable younger players are not selected simply because of their age.  Since they are not given the same opportunities as the older kids, they don’t develop the same skills and eventually drop out of competitive soccer.</p>

<p>If the cut-off for competitive soccer in enough countries is January 1st, that would support the phenomena you see.  A similar phenomena has been observed in several other sports including baseball and ice hockey.</p>
